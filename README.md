## Credits

This web portfolio was originally based on the open-source project [Flask-Portfolio by Dhrumil Mistry](https://github.com/dmdhrumilmistry/Flask-Portfolio).  
Iâ€™ve used it as a foundation and will be customizing it to reflect my own skills, projects, and personal design preferences.

Shoutout to the dev community for always sharing knowledge and code ðŸ™Œ
